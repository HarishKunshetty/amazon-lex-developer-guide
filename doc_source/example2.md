Using AWS SDKs, you can integrate your Amazon Lex bot with your mobile applications\. For more information, see [ Add Conversational Bots to Your Mobile App with Amazon Lex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/add-aws-mobile-conversational-bots.html) in the *AWS Mobile Developer Guide*\.

You can also use the AWS Mobile Hub to create a quickstart mobile app that demonstrates using the Amazon Lex SDK in iOS and Android mobile applications\.
